## Notes
- For learning a new technology this is my process.
- Reading the documentation for initial start.
- Watching youtube tutorials/ Free online courses for better understanding of implementation.
- Taking a look at similar projects on github.
- MySQL is very simple to learn, understand and write.
- Writing MySQL statements similar to writing python.
- I think we should go with Laravel as our Web Framework
- As it is well maintained widely used and will handle all our work including handling database managment
