# Documentation for Apache Server

## Links
[Apache Server Project FAQ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/httpd/FAQ#FAQ-WhatisApache?)
This is worth a read, or at least a quick glance. It explains everything about the Apache Server Project much better and more concisely than I would have been able to here.

[Apache Server Project Landing Page](https://httpd.apache.org/)
The starting page for information about Apache's HTTP server. Most information and links can be found here.

[Apache Server Main Documentation Page](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/)
Lots of information about how to use Apache Server is here, though it's unclear how much is relevant to this project. Specifically, I assume that UB has a basic Apache backend setup that we can point to our homepage, so we probably don't need to do the initial web server setup. However, we'll probably want our algorithm to run on the server backend, so we'll need to look into how to do that, what language(s) to use, and where the files we need to modify live.

## Tutorials
There is a tutorials section on the "Apache Server Main Documentation Page" linked above.

## Repositories
[Apache Server GitHub Repository](https://github.com/apache/httpd)
The source code for the Apache Server Project. This probably won't be needed, but is nice to have anyways.
